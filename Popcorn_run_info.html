        <p>
            First launched in 2017, the GSC Popcorn Run has since been an annual event on our calendars! The fun-filled event is aimed at 
            encouraging Malaysians to stay active whilst bonding over movies and popcorn with their loved ones and friends.  Each year features 
            a different movie, complete with a fiesta of food and drinks, movie-themed pit-stops, giveaways and a chance to meet your favourite 
            movie characters! Each edition of the run features exclusive movie-themed medals and merchandise. <br><br>

            2022's edition of the run saw GSC's joint effort with Air Selangor to present the inaugural GSC X Air Selangor Hydro Run in 
            collaboration with Mechamato's official movie partners Astro Shaw and Monsta, official venue partner IOI City Mall Putrajaya, and 
            sponsors Applecrumby, McCain, Milo, Coca-Cola, V-Sure and Federal Flour Mills (FFM). With over 3,500 participants, families came 
            together to bond over their favourite movie characters and popcorn, over a series of fun activities.
