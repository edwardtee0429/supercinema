                First launched in 2017, the GSC Popcorn Run has since been an annual event on our calendars!
                 The fun-filled event is aimed at encouraging Malaysians to stay active whilst bonding over movies and popcorn with their loved
                 ones and friends.  Each year features a different movie, complete with a fiesta of food and drinks, movie-themed pit-stops, 
                 giveaways and a chance to meet your favourite movie characters! Each edition of the run features exclusive movie-themed medals 
                 and merchandise. <br><br>
                 
                 2022's edition of the run saw GSC's joint effort with Air Selangor to present the inaugural GSC X Air Selangor
                 Hydro Run in collaboration with Mechamato's official movie partners Astro Shaw and Monsta, official venue partner IOI City Mall
                 Putrajaya, and sponsors Applecrumby, McCain, Milo, Coca-Cola, V-Sure and Federal Flour Mills (FFM). With over 3,500 participants,
                families came together to bond over their favourite movie characters and popcorn, over a series of fun activities.
